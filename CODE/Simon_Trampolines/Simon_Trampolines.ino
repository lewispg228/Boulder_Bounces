 Simon Says is a memory game. Start the game by pressing one of the four buttons. When a button lights up, 
 press the button, repeating the sequence. The sequence will get longer and longer. The game is won after 
 13 rounds.
 
 This code is public domain but you buy me a beer if you use this and we meet someday (Beerware license).
 
 Simon Says game originally written in C for the PIC16F88.
 Ported for the ATmega168, then ATmega328, then Arduino 1.0.
 Fixes and cleanup by Joshua Neal <joshua[at]trochotron.com>
 
 Generates random sequence, plays music, and displays button lights.
 
 Simon tones from Wikipedia
 - A (red, upper left) - 440Hz - 2.272ms - 1.136ms pulse
 - a (green, upper right, an octave higher than A) - 880Hz - 1.136ms,
 0.568ms pulse
 - D (blue, lower left, a perfect fourth higher than the upper left) 
 587.33Hz - 1.702ms - 0.851ms pulse
 - G (yellow, lower right, a perfect fourth higher than the lower left) - 
 784Hz - 1.276ms - 0.638ms pulse
 
 The tones are close, but probably off a bit, but they sound all right.
 
 The old version of SparkFun simon used an ATmega8. An ATmega8 ships
 with a default internal 1MHz oscillator.  You will need to set the
 internal fuses to operate at the correct external 16MHz oscillator.
 
 Original Fuses:
 avrdude -p atmega8 -P lpt1 -c stk200 -U lfuse:w:0xE1:m -U hfuse:w:0xD9:m
 
 Command to set to fuses to use external 16MHz: 
 avrdude -p atmega8 -P lpt1 -c stk200 -U lfuse:w:0xEE:m -U hfuse:w:0xC9:m
 
 The current version of Simon uses the ATmega328. The external osciallator
 was removed to reduce component count.  This version of simon relies on the
 internal default 1MHz osciallator. Do not set the external fuses.

 Modifying code to work better for trampolines

1) 
 Fix bug on startup when all four players are standing on trampolines
 -I think this is something to do with the variable keeping track of if trampolines have been "up" meaning someone jumped up or steped off completely.
  - This is necessary so that you can stand on the trampolines or "walk" from one to another. It makes the triggering occur only when a trampoline crosses the threshold
   - of high to low. FIXED 3/2/2016

2)
 Increase playback speed as sequence grows. This will allow for faster playing. We are planning on having groups of 4 play for 2 minutes, so they need to be able to try a few times,
 and potentially win a round within that time frame. ADDED 3/2/2016

3)
  One of the tablah sounds is too low for the computer speakers to actually make, so I need to change this to a sound that will be heard.
  Also, it could be good to choose some more groups to add variety. FIXED 3/2/2016

4) 
Add some code to avoid repeating the same button more than 2 times in a sequence DONE 3/2/2016 - mostly happens in add_to_moves()

5)
Ensure that each button gets chosen an equal amount. This will ensure that when you are playing four player trampolines, everyone gets to jump.
