# Boulder Bounces
The Museum of Boulder exhibit designers have paired with SparkFun to create Boulder Bounces: a mashup of Simon Says on trampolines. With sounds and spot lights triggering for every jump in the room, the exhibit is a bouncy blast for all ages.

Also includes slightly different code for the "Mighty Mini" and "Hop & Hear".
