These audio files are organized by file name.

the numbers before the dash are what the Tsunami cares about, the other part of the filename is just to know what it is.

Each group of sounds that the user can select has 10 "spots".

Each group starts at the "tens". so bird sounds are tracks 30-39

jungle: 10-19
cartoons: 20-29
birds: 30-39
ocean: 40-49
farm: 50-59
colorado: 60-69
